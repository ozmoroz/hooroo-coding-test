# Instructions

We would like you to work on this coding test so we can see how you would approach building out this feature. We think you should spend about 4 hours on the code test, we consider it a starting point to extend and modify in our technical interview.

## User Story to Implement

As a user of Qantas hotels I would like to see a list of hotels that can be sorted by price.

## More Information

Use the attached image of the search page as a guide and feel free to use any technology that you are comfortable with. It is not neccessary to translate the design pixel-perfect, we don't care for specific fonts or color values, but we would like you to stick as close to it as possible.

Implement both these sorting options:
- Price (high-low)
- Price (low-high)

Star ratings on properties are divided into two types: ‘star’ and ‘self’ rated. Properties that are ‘self’ rated use a circle icon and properties that are ‘star’ rated use a star icon.

We value writing well tested code at Hooroo and would like to see tests around any code you write.

Feel free to send through any questions you may have.

## Included files

- JSON payload
- Mock of Qantas search results
